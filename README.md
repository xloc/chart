# Chart

I want to render charts based on structured text

charts includes:
- flow chart
- knowledge graph

structured text:
- yaml

## Existing tools

There are existing tools but they all have their limitations:
- diagrams.net
  - ✅ online diagram edit tool
  - ✅ nice interactive editing
  - ❗️ but, all nodes must be add manually. what if it is generated using text
- Mermaid
  - ✅ text based chart generation
  - ✅ write code to draw chart
  - ❗️ but, no interactive edit. adding new connection, moving nodes are difficult
  - ❗️ auto-layout is the only option
